# Demo Project

This is a lightweight demo project page used to show how projects are documented in this site. It includes a short overview, features, tech stack, installation and usage instructions, and links to a repository and live demo.

## Overview

The Demo Project is a small example application demonstrating documentation patterns used across this collection of personal projects. It's intentionally minimal so you can copy the layout and adapt it for your own projects.

## Highlights / Features

- Clean, minimal README-style docs inside the site
- Installation and run instructions for pnpm / npm / yarn
- Example usage snippet
- Links to repository and live demo placeholder

## Tech stack

- Next.js (app router)
- MDX for docs
- React + TypeScript

## Install

Choose your package manager:

```bash copy showLineNumbers
# using pnpm
pnpm install

# using npm
npm install

# using yarn
yarn
```

## Run (development)

```bash copy showLineNumbers
# pnpm
pnpm dev

# npm
npm run dev

# yarn
yarn dev
```

## Example usage

Here's a tiny example showing how to import the library (or component) this demo might expose. Replace the import path with your real package or local path.

```tsx copy showLineNumbers
import { DemoComponent } from 'demo-project'

export default function Example() {
  return <DemoComponent message="Hello from demo project" />
}
```

## Repository / Live demo

- Repository: (replace with your repo) â€” https://github.com/your-username/demo-project
- Live demo: https://your-demo.example.com

## Notes

Feel free to copy this file to other project folders and adapt the sections. If you'd like, I can also create a starter project skeleton (src, tests, CI) and wire up a README and package.json.
