## The GNU/Linux Architecture

In the previous article, we established that a functional GNU/Linux operating system is the combination of the **Linux Kernel** and the **GNU tools**.

The "architecture" of an OS describes how these components are layered and how they interact. The most fundamental concept in the GNU/Linux architecture is the strict separation between two primary modes of operation: **Kernel Space** and **User Space**.

This separation is the key to the system's stability. A crashing user application (in User Space) cannot bring down the entire operating system (which runs in Kernel Space).

---

## 1. Kernel Space

Think of Kernel Space as a protected, privileged area where the core of the operating system lives and works.

- **What is it?** The memory space where the **Linux Kernel** runs.
- **Privileges:** Code running in Kernel Space has direct, unrestricted access to all the computer's hardware (CPU, memory, disks, network cards, etc.).
- **What it does:** This is where the kernel performs its core tasks:
  - **Process Management:** Deciding which application gets to use the CPU and for how long.
  - **Memory Management:** Allocating and protecting system memory.
  - **Device Drivers:** The kernel includes drivers that act as "translators" between the hardware and the software.
  - **System Calls:** Manages the interface that User Space applications use to request services.

## 2. User Space

Think of User Space as the non-privileged, isolated area where all your applications run.

- **What is it?** The memory space where everything _except_ the kernel runs.
- **Privileges:** Code running in User Space has **no** direct access to hardware. If an application wants to do _anything_—like read a file, send a network packet, or even print to the screen—it must ask the kernel to do it.
- **What runs here:**
  - **Applications:** Web browsers, text editors, servers (like Apache), and your own scripts.
  - **GNU Utilities:** The commands you use every day, like `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, and the `bash` shell itself.
  - **Libraries:** Collections of code that applications share (e.g., `glibc`, `libcurl`).
  - **Desktop Environments:** The entire graphical user interface (GUI), like GNOME or KDE.

## The Bridge: System Calls & `glibc`

So, how does a User Space application (like `ls`) ask the Kernel to read the contents of a directory? It uses a **System Call**.

1.  **The "Syscall" Interface:** This is the _only_ bridge between User Space and Kernel Space. It's a strictly defined set of functions the kernel exposes.
2.  **The Problem:** Raw system calls are complex and often written in assembly language.
3.  **The Solution: `glibc`:** The **GNU C Library (`glibc`)** provides a user-friendly wrapper around these system calls.

When a developer uses a simple C function like `printf()` (to write to the screen) or `open()` (to open a file), `glibc` takes that simple command and translates it into the complex system call the kernel understands.

## Architecture at a Glance: Layers and Components

To summarize, here is a visual representation of the GNU/Linux architectural layers, followed by a breakdown of the key components from the bottom up.

![GNU/Linux Architecture Diagram](/100-days-of-cloud/linux/gnu-linux-architecture.png)

1.  **Hardware:** The physical foundation (CPU, RAM, Disks, Network Interfaces).
2.  **Linux Kernel (Kernel Space):** The core manager, directly interfacing with hardware and providing essential services.
3.  **GNU C Library (`glibc`, User Space):** The fundamental library that applications use to interact with the kernel via system calls.
4.  **Other Libraries (User Space):** Shared code modules that provide additional functionality to applications.
5.  **Shells & Utilities (User Space):** Command-line interfaces like `bash` and essential tools like `ls`, `cp`, `mv`.
6.  **Applications (User Space):** User-facing programs such as web browsers (Firefox), text editors (Vim), and web servers (Apache).
7.  **Desktop Environment (User Space):** The graphical interface you interact with (e.g., GNOME, KDE).

### Example: What Happens When You Type `ls`?

This step-by-step example shows the full architecture in action, moving between User Space and Kernel Space.

<Steps>

<step>
  ### 1. You type `ls` in the shell You are interacting with a User Space
  application (like `bash`). The shell reads your command.
</step>

<step>
  ### 2. The shell `fork()`s The `bash` shell needs to run the `ls` program.
  First, it calls the `fork()` system call. This crosses the bridge to **Kernel
  Space** and tells the kernel to create a new child process that is an
  identical copy of the shell.
</step>

<step>
  ### 3. The child process `exec()`s The new child process (still in **User
  Space**) immediately calls the `exec()` system call. This tells the kernel to
  "execute a new program." The kernel finds the `ls` binary on disk (e.g., at
  `/bin/ls`) and loads it into the child process's memory, replacing the copy of
  the shell. The process is now the `ls` program.
</step>

<step>
  ### 4. `ls` calls `glibc` (User Space) The `ls` program needs to read the
  contents of the current directory. It can't access the disk directly. It calls
  a standard function from the **`glibc`** library (e.g., `readdir()`), all
  within **User Space**.
</step>

<step>
  ### 5. `glibc` calls the Kernel (System Call) `glibc` translates the simple
  `readdir()` function into a specific **system call** (like `getdents64`). This
  call crosses the bridge from User Space into **Kernel Space**, formally asking
  the kernel for the directory contents.
</step>

<step>
  ### 6. Kernel gets the data The Kernel (now in **Kernel Space**) takes over.
  Its VFS (Virtual File System) layer and filesystem drivers (e.g., `ext4`)
  interact with the hardware disk drivers to read the raw directory data from
  the disk.
</step>

<step>
  ### 7. Kernel returns data to `ls` The Kernel passes the directory data back
  across the bridge to the `ls` process, which is waiting in **User Space**.
</step>

<step>
  ### 8. `ls` needs to print the data The `ls` program (User Space) formats the
  file names into a string. It now needs to print this string to your screen. It
  calls another `glibc` function, `write()`.
</step>

<step>
  ### 9. `glibc` calls the Kernel *again* `glibc` translates the `write()`
  function into a `write()` **system call**. This crosses the bridge into
  **Kernel Space** *again*, handing the string of text to the kernel and telling
  it to send it to "standard output."
</step>

<step>
  ### 10. Kernel prints to the terminal The Kernel (Kernel Space) receives the
  text. It sees that "standard output" is your terminal and uses the TTY
  (terminal) driver to send the text to your terminal application. The terminal
  application (User Space) renders the text, and you see your file list.
</step>

<step>
  ### 11. `ls` exits and shell returns The `ls` program finishes its job and
  makes a final system call, `exit()`. The Kernel cleans up the process. The
  original `bash` shell, which was waiting, is notified that its child is done
  and finally prints a new command prompt.
</step>

</Steps>
