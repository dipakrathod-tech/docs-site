## Finding Help and Documentation

One of the most critical skills for mastering Linux is learning how to find help on your own. The system has a comprehensive, built-in documentation system that can teach you about almost any command. This guide covers the essential tools you'll use to find documentation and discover new commands.

<Callout type="info">
  **Why This Matters:** You will never memorize every command and every option. Knowing how to look up information quickly and efficiently is what separates a novice from an expert. This is your key to becoming self-sufficient on the command line.

## `man`: The System Manual

The `man` (manual) command is your primary source for detailed documentation. It provides access to the official system manual pages for commands, configuration files, system calls, and more.

### How to Use `man`

To view the manual page for a command, simply type `man` followed by the command name:

```bash copy
man ls
```

This will open the manual page for the `ls` command in a pager (usually `less`), allowing you to scroll through the documentation.

### Navigating a `man` Page

Since `man` uses `less` to display content, you can use the same navigation keys:

| Key          | Action                     |
| ------------ | -------------------------- |
| **Space**    | Move forward one screen    |
| **b**        | Move backward one screen   |
| **Up/Down**  | Scroll by line             |
| **/pattern** | Search forward for a term  |
| **n**        | Find the next search match |
| **q**        | Quit the `man` page        |

### Structure of a `man` Page

Manual pages are organized into standard sections, which makes them easy to read once you're familiar with the layout:

-   **NAME**: The name of the command and a brief one-line description.
-   **SYNOPSIS**: The command's syntax, showing how to use it with options and arguments.
-   **DESCRIPTION**: A detailed explanation of what the command does.
-   **OPTIONS**: An alphabetized list of all command-line options and what they do.
-   **EXAMPLES**: Practical examples of how to use the command.
-   **FILES**: A list of files related to the command (e.g., configuration files).
-   **SEE ALSO**: A list of related commands and manual pages.

<Callout type="default">
  **Pro Tip:** The **SYNOPSIS** and **EXAMPLES** sections are often the most useful for getting started quickly.
</Callout>

### Manual Page Sections

Linux manuals are divided into numbered sections. Sometimes, the same name exists in multiple sections (e.g., `passwd` the command vs. `passwd` the file format).

You can specify a section number to get the correct page:

-   `man 1 passwd` → Shows the manual for the `passwd` **command**.
-   `man 5 passwd` → Shows the manual for the `/etc/passwd` **file format**.

**Standard Manual Sections:**

| Section | Description                                                  |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1**   | Executable programs or shell commands                        |
| **2**   | System calls (functions provided by the kernel)              |
| **3**   | Library calls (functions within program libraries, like `libc`) |
| **4**   | Special files (usually found in `/dev`)                      |
| **5**   | File formats and conventions (e.g., `/etc/passwd`)           |
| **6**   | Games                                                        |
| **7**   | Miscellaneous (overviews, conventions, and protocols)        |
| **8**   | System administration commands (usually for root)            |
| **9**   | Kernel routines [Non standard]                               |

If you don't specify a number, `man` searches the sections in order and shows the first match it finds.

## `--help`: The Quick Reference

For a faster, more concise summary of a command's options, most commands provide a `--help` flag.

```bash copy
ls --help
```

Output:

```
Usage: ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...
List information about the FILEs (the current directory by default).
Sort entries alphabetically if none of -cftuvSUX nor --sort is specified.

  -a, --all                  do not ignore entries starting with .
  -A, --almost-all           do not list implied . and ..
      --author               with -l, print the author of each file
... (output truncated) ...
```

<Callout type="success">
  **`man` vs. `--help`**

  - Use **`--help`** when you just need a quick reminder of a command's syntax or a specific option.
  - Use **`man`** when you need a detailed understanding of what a command does, how it works, and want to see practical examples.
</Callout>

## `apropos` and `whatis`: Discovering Commands

What if you know *what* you want to do, but you don't know the name of the command? The `apropos` command searches the NAME section of all manual pages for a keyword.

### `apropos`

Imagine you want to find commands related to "users":

```bash copy
apropos "user"
```

Output:

```
useradd (8)          - create a new user or update default new user information
userdel (8)          - delete a user account and related files
usermod (8)          - modify a user account
users (1)            - print the user names of users currently logged in
...
```

This is an incredibly powerful way to discover new tools.

### `whatis`

The `whatis` command gives you the one-line description from the NAME section of a `man` page. It's a very quick way to identify a command.

```bash copy
whatis ls
```

Output:

```
ls (1)               - list directory contents
```

<Callout type="info">
  **Did you know?**

  The `apropos` and `whatis` commands are actually shortcuts for flags to the `man` command itself:
  - `apropos <keyword>` is the same as `man -k <keyword>`.
  - `whatis <command>` is the same as `man -f <command>`.
</Callout>

## `info`: Hypertextual Documentation

The `info` command provides access to the GNU Project's documentation system. `info` pages are often more in-depth than `man` pages and are structured like a website with hyperlinks (called "nodes").

```bash copy
info coreutils
```

While powerful, the `info` interface can be less intuitive than `man`. For most day-to-day tasks, `man` and `--help` are sufficient.

---

## `/usr/share/doc`: Package Documentation

Finally, the `/usr/share/doc` directory contains documentation installed by software packages. Here, you can often find README files, configuration examples, tutorials, and other detailed information that doesn't fit in a `man` page.

```bash copy
ls /usr/share/doc/bash
```

Output:

```
README  examples/  FAQ  NEWS  ...
```

This is a great place to look for in-depth guides and sample configurations.

---

## Summary

-   **`man <command>`**: Your primary tool for detailed, comprehensive documentation.
-   **`<command> --help`**: The best option for a quick syntax and options reminder.
-   **`apropos <keyword>`**: Your discovery tool for finding commands related to a topic.
-   **`whatis <command>`**: Provides a brief, one-line description of a command.
-   **`/usr/share/doc`**: A directory containing extra documentation from installed packages.
