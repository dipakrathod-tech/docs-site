# Demo Workshop

Estimated time: ~60 minutes

This demo workshop shows a concise workshop format you can reuse: agenda, prerequisites, setup, hands-on steps, and resources.

## Agenda

1. Introduction (10m)
2. Setup & environment check (10m)
3. Hands-on lab (30m)
4. Wrap-up & next steps (10m)

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ installed
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)
- Git

## Setup

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash copy showLineNumbers
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
pnpm install
```

If you use npm:

```bash copy showLineNumbers
npm install
```

## Quick environment check

Run the dev server and confirm the site opens at http://localhost:3000

```bash copy showLineNumbers
pnpm dev
```

## Hands-on lab (example)

Create a tiny component in `src/components/WorkshopDemo.tsx` and export it.

```tsx copy showLineNumbers
import React from 'react'

export function WorkshopDemo() {
  return (
    <div style={{ padding: 12, borderRadius: 8, background: 'rgba(0,0,0,0.04)' }}>
      <strong>Workshop demo</strong>
      <p>This component was created during the workshop.</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Import and use it in a page or MDX to preview.

## Resources

- Repo: https://github.com/your-username/your-repo
- Slides: (add link)

## Notes

I can scaffold the example component and wire it into the site so workshop attendees can preview it immediately. Want me to create `src/components/WorkshopDemo.tsx` and add an import example in the workshop page?
