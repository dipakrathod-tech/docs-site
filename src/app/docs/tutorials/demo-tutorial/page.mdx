# Demo Tutorial

This demo tutorial shows a small, self-contained walkthrough you can use as a template for other tutorials in this site. It includes goals, prerequisites, step-by-step instructions, and a tiny example you can copy.

## Goal

By the end of this tutorial you'll have a tiny example app/component running locally and understand how to document a tutorial in this repository.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (16+ recommended)
- pnpm, npm, or yarn

If you're on Windows and using PowerShell (the default shell for this workspace), the commands shown in code blocks will work with `pwsh`.

## Steps

1. Install dependencies

```powershell copy showLineNumbers
# using pnpm
pnpm install

# or npm
npm install
```

2. Run the development server

```powershell copy showLineNumbers
# pnpm
pnpm dev

# npm
npm run dev
```

3. Open the site at http://localhost:3000

## Tiny example

Below is a minimal React component example you can drop into a file such as `src/components/DemoTutorialExample.tsx`.

```tsx copy showLineNumbers
import React from 'react'

type Props = { message?: string }

export function DemoTutorialExample({ message = 'Hello from the demo tutorial' }: Props) {
  return (
    <div style={{ padding: 16, borderRadius: 8, background: 'rgba(0,0,0,0.03)' }}>
      <h3>{message}</h3>
      <p>This is a minimal component used for tutorial purposes.</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Notes

- Replace commands and file paths to match the real project you're documenting.
- If you'd like, I can also scaffold the example component and wire it into the site so you can preview it immediately.
