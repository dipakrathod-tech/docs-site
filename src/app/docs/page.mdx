# Welcome to My Cloud & DevOps Documentation

Hi there! I'm Alex, a passionate cloud engineer and developer. I created this documentation website as a central hub for my personal projects, technical guides, and curated resources on AWS, DevOps, and software development.

Whether you're looking for a step-by-step tutorial or an in-depth project breakdown, I hope you find something useful here.

<br />

## What You'll Find Here

This site is organized into several key sections to help you navigate:

* **Project Documentation:** Detailed documentation and code for my personal projects, including architecture diagrams and setup instructions.
* **AWS & DevOps Resources:** Guides on building and managing infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and best practices for cloud-native applications.
* **Development Guides:** Practical guides and tutorials for various programming languages, frameworks, and tools.
* **Workshops & Tutorials:** Hands-on, step-by-step tutorials to help you learn new skills.
