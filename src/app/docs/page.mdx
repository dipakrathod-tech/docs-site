- Enable MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)
- Regularly rotate credentials

### AWS KMS

AWS Key Management Service (KMS) makes it easy to create and control cryptographic keys.

---

## Management and Monitoring

### AWS CloudWatch

Amazon CloudWatch monitors your AWS resources and applications in real time.

### AWS CloudTrail

AWS CloudTrail records AWS API calls for your account and delivers log files to you.

---

## Developer Tools

### AWS CodeCommit

A fully managed source control service that makes it easy for teams to host secure and scalable Git repositories.

### AWS CodeBuild

A fully managed continuous integration service that compiles source code, runs tests, and produces software packages.

---

## Machine Learning and AI

### Amazon SageMaker

A fully managed service that provides every developer and data scientist with the ability to build, train, and deploy machine learning models quickly.

### AWS Rekognition

A service that makes it easy to add image and video analysis to your applications.

---

## Best Practices

- **Design for Failure:** Assume that everything can fail and design your applications to be resilient.
- **Automate Everything:** Use infrastructure as code (e.g., AWS CloudFormation, Terraform).
- **Monitor Continuously:** Use CloudWatch and CloudTrail for monitoring and logging.
- **Secure Your Environment:** Implement IAM best practices, encrypt data, and use security groups.
- **Optimize Costs:** Use the AWS Pricing Calculator, monitor usage, and leverage Reserved Instances.
